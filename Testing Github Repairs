Testing Github Repairs


Let's push a commit to Apr22Reset, off of commit 3d16c1f7

Ok, that seemed to work. Let's check what our branches are and which holds what data:

Terri---Sprint-4 / origin
    commit: a47cf42bd084eefc2793ae3fc66bf6701b16f93c
    Holds my aborted attempt to create a ledgerWidget.jsp and seperate account holder dashboard.

main / origin       origin/HEAD
    commit: 15f87eda2bcce52f5d8044919387d99157a261bf
    These seem to both point to the same commit, and contain buggy text due to an aborted github merge.

Terri---Sprint-4-Rebuild / origin
    commit: 184a17acaf1be4fd36b630a175af6e38ba739c52
    Just added the target directory to gitIgnore.

Apr22Reset
    commit: f5d12e7161e9705889eb0d5956591a7c68e110cb
    Current branch from line 4 above, used to test.

origin / Apr22Reset
    commit: c76fb646b0470e3ae2b71cce2940ea5d3a62f20a
    Appears to have commit a47cf42bd084eefc2793ae3fc66bf6701b16f93c (where Terri---Sprint-4 is currently set?) applied?


Ok, that last commit to Apr22Reset turned it into Apr22Reset / origin... so it remerged with origin / Apr22Reset?
Will my uncommitted changes - apparently not associated with origin / Apr22Reset be applied to Apr22Reset?
(It says "Ctrl-Enter to commit on Apr22Reset)

Yes. Yes it did.
